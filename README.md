# Discord-like Chat App (Personal Project)

This repository contains a personal, educational project that explores how a Discord-like chat application can be built using a modern web frontend and a cloud-native, serverless backend.

The goal of this project is learning and experimentation, not production use. It focuses on real-time messaging concepts, AWS serverless architecture, and clean separation between client and server.

⚠️ This project is not affiliated with Discord. All branding, assets, and UI are original or sourced from open libraries.

## 🖥️ Client (Frontend)

Tech Stack
- React
- TypeScript
- WebSocket (via API Gateway)
- Modern component-based UI

Responsibilities
- User interface (channels, chat, messages)
- WebSocket connection management
- Sending and receiving real-time messages
- Authentication token handling

Run locally

```
cd client
pnpm install
pnpm run dev
```


## ☁️ Server (Backend)

Tech Stack
- Go (Golang)
- AWS Lambda
- API Gateway (WebSocket API)
- DynamoDB
- S3 (optional, for attachments)

Responsibilities
- WebSocket connection lifecycle ($connect, $disconnect)
- Message routing and fan-out
- Message persistence
- Channel membership management

## 🧠 Learning Goals

This project is designed to help understand:
- Real-time systems using WebSockets
- Serverless architecture on AWS
- Event-driven backend design
- Go for cloud-native services
- Cost-efficient scaling for small workloads
